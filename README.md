This is a Python-based Sudoku Solver Flask web app that utilizes computer vision to identify the puzzle in the uploaded image, Tesseract OCR to identify the numbers in the cells, and a handwritten forward-looking, constraint propagation backtracking Sudoku algorithm to output a easy-to-view solution of the Sudoku. Enjoy!

Inspired by coursework at TJHSST AI 1&2, Berkeley CS180 (Computer Vision), Berkeley CS188 (Artificial Intelligence)
